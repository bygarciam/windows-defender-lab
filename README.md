# Hands-on Lab: Windows Defender (AV Baseline + Scheduled Scan)

## 🔐 Why this matters (Security)
Microsoft Defender is a core endpoint security control for **malware prevention, detection, and response**.  
In banking/regulated environments, having Defender **enabled, updated, and validated with evidence** supports **security hygiene, audit readiness, and incident prevention**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Confirm Defender core protections are enabled (Real-time protection)
- Validate Defender is updated (Security intelligence / Protection updates)
- Run an on-demand scan (Quick scan)
- Create a scheduled scan using Task Scheduler (weekly full scan)
- Validate detection visibility using the EICAR test file (Protection history)

## 🖥️ Environment
- Hypervisor: **VMware Workstation**
- OS: **Windows Server 2022**
- Security tool: **Microsoft Defender Antivirus**
- Scheduler: **Windows Task Scheduler**

## 🧪 Lab Steps (Summary)
1. Open **Windows Security → Virus & threat protection**
2. Run a **Quick scan** to validate on-demand scanning works
3. Confirm **Real-time protection** is **ON**
4. Check **Protection updates** and confirm Security intelligence is up to date
5. Create a **weekly scheduled scan** using Task Scheduler:
   - General: run whether user is logged on or not + run with highest privileges
   - Trigger: weekly schedule (example: Sundays at 3:00 AM)
   - Action: run `MpCmdRun.exe` with scan arguments
   - Conditions/Settings: wake to run, retries, and allow run on demand
6. Validate the task appears in Task Scheduler and will run on schedule
7. (Validation) Download the **EICAR** test file and confirm Defender logs it in **Protection history**

## ⌨️ Commands / Configuration used

### Defender scheduled scan (Task Scheduler Action)
**Program/script:**
`C:\ProgramFiles\Windows Defender\MpCmdRun.exe`

**Arguments (example):**
- Quick scan: `-Scan -ScanType 1`
- Full scan: `-Scan -ScanType 2`

> In this lab, the scheduled task was configured for a **weekly Full Scan**.

## 💡 Key Takeaways
- Defender must be **enabled and up to date** to reduce exposure to commodity malware and known threats.
- Running an **on-demand scan** and confirming **real-time protection** verifies baseline endpoint security posture.
- Scheduling scans via **Task Scheduler + MpCmdRun.exe** ensures consistent hygiene and repeatable controls.
- **Protection history** provides evidence for investigations and audits (visibility into detections and actions taken).
- The **EICAR test file** is a safe way to validate detection and logging without using real malware.
